# Ops 201d5 Code Challenges
A repository for the Ops 201 coding challenges.


- What is this repo all about?
  - This repository is a place that I upload all of my scripting and automation challenges for the seattle-ops-201d5 course.
- Why are you learning these skills?
  - Automation! In the vast field that is Cybersecurity, there are a plethora of tasks that can be easily automated for the sake of efficiency and productivity. Learning the basic fundamentals of code and environments like Powershell, Bash, and others give us the ability to create these automated processes and enables us to work smarter, not harder.
- What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
  - In 201, I gained a great understanding of the funamental coding concepts and data types, such as; boolean, strings, integers, objects, arrays, and functions. I learned how each of these data types is portrayed differently in different scripting environments and how to successfully implement them for the purpose of the automating process,
- What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
  - My favorite challenge was probably the one where we first learned how to implement loops into a script. On that one specifically, I dug a bit deeper and learned about Regular Expressions, which are a way to implement integers into your code as variables. In my code I created an 'until' loop where the script asks the user for the input of a number. It works in such a way that the input is required to be a number of some type and cannot be a string of letters and numbers.
- How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
  - They can be applied by creating scripts that automate endpoint user configurations, I have one such example included here in the repository. They can be used to automate a plethora of different tasks to make the workplace and the user much more efficient and require much less effort on the user's part. 
- What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
  - I would choose to improve my hardware list script, specifically what I would do is make it so that when you run it, it creates a new window that displays a table of all the components installed in a system and their specifications.
- What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
  - I hope to further develop my knowledge of Powershell and Bash specifically, as I really like both of those shell environments for coding. Powershell is a bit easier considering it is mostly in plain language and most commands are very intuitive in how they are worded.
